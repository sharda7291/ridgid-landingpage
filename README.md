Plumbers must have equipment

"I have been using Ridgid’s sewer cameras for years and they continue to impress. The picture is great and with familiar tools that are instinctive to use. The push rod is firm enough to push out and through turns without kinking. I use these weekly along with Ridgid locators for pre-construction camera surveys and they work perfectly."
